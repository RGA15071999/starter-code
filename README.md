starter-code
--------------

This repo contains various directories that should help you get
started with software projects. 

For example, a starter `React` project is listed in the `javascript`
directory. 

# JavaScript
After cloning this repository, change directories to the `javascript`
directory and type `npm install`. This will install all the
dependencies of the project. After that you can do: `npm run
front-end-server` to start up a simple dev server which lets you see
changes done to your `JSX` in realtime.

# C++ 

The `cpp` directory contains a `Makefile` to get you started, read the
comments in the `Makefile` and add your project's files as
appropriate, then you can just invoke `make`.
